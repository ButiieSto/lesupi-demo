  <h2>About the Book</h2>
  <p>Welcome to Hypercondria™ — a flawless, medically optimized town where not having a disorder is the ultimate red flag.</p>
  <p>Here, wellness is currency, therapy is mandatory, and your daily dose of medication isn’t just encouraged — it’s celebrated. From Diagnosipops™ to Sadness Management Seminars, everyone’s a proud patient. Feeling fine? You’re clearly in denial.</p>
  <p>Enter Hloux, a quiet skeptic with a suspiciously clean medical record. When a chance encounter with a rebellious soul named Noni exposes him to the glitch beneath the system’s polished smile, Hloux begins to see the truth: they don’t need to drug you — just convince you to medicate yourself.</p>
  <p>As they descend deeper into the pharmaceutical funhouse, dodging Side-Effect Evangelists, Dopamine Influencers, and pill-pushing prophets, Hloux and Noni must unlearn everything the town has branded “self-care.” Because beneath the synthetic joy and curated neuroses, something unmedicated is waking up...</p>
  <p><strong>And it’s not approved by the Council of Diagnostics™.</strong></p>

  <h2>What Readers Are Saying</h2>
  <div class="testimonial">
    "I loved it, as it was very quirky, funny and thought provoking."
  </div>
  <div class="testimonial">
    "The Looney Hypochondriacs is a brilliantly satirical romp through the neuroses of a truly unforgettable character. With razor-sharp wit and clever cultural references, the author delivers a hilarious take on health obsessions, self-diagnoses, and the absurdities of modern medicine. Each page had me laughing out loud, sometimes in disbelief, often in recognition. It's clever, entertaining, and full of dry humor that hits the mark."
